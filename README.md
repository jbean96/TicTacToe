# TicTacToe
Python code for a tic-tac-toe game that runs in a shell

The code in this repository contains all the framework for running a graphical game of tic-tac-toe in the shell. In order to play a game
run ticTacToe2.py which will allow you to choose your player piece ("X" or "O") and play against an intelligent opponent who will never
be able to lose. By default the game pins you against xo_player_smart.py which uses minimax in order to choose the best moves when playing
an ideal game of tic-tac-toe. For this reason the computer will never lose.
